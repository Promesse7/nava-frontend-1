7. **Dashboard Layout**: More modern dashboard with better data visualization
8. **Voice Interface**: Enhanced voice booking interface design

## Testing Protocol
When testing is required, use the following agents:
- **Backend Testing**: `deep_testing_backend_v2` (not applicable for this design-focused project)
- **Frontend Testing**: `auto_frontend_testing_agent` (ask user permission first)

## Incorporate User Feedback
- User specifically requested black and white designs
- Focus on making the existing functionality "great" through design improvements
- Maintain all existing features while enhancing visual design
- Consider modern design trends while keeping the elegant black/white theme
